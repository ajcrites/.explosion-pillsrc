# Syntax check on all php files in the specified revision or currently changed files
#  if no revision is specified
# Note: This will not run php -l on the files as they were in the revision, but as they are
#  in the location you run it. This is probably desired, fortunately.
# Gotcha: If the dev uploads a changeset with a syntax error that has been corrected in a later
#  changeset or in their current file changes and that changeset becomes the tip of the repo,
#  the syntax error will not be caught simply by phpl.  Devs should avoid doing this, though.
# This can only be run in a mercurial repo
# Has a dependency on `hgfiles`, at least if you want to provide a changeset
# Will not print anything if there are no php files to check
